Autofac and Primitive obsession: how I learned to love the injection of configuration parameters
================================================================================================

Registering components in Autofac is straightforward, as long as no primitive dependencies (such as connection strings, URLs and configuration parameters in general) are involved. This post describes the strategy for dealing with primitive dependencies.

## The ordinary case

Say you have a class `Foo` depending on `Bar`: 

```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(Bar bar) { }
}

class Bar {}
```

Registering both of them
with Autofac is just simple as writing:

```csharp
var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
builder.RegisterType<Foo>();
builder.RegisterType<Bar>();
```

This is enough for Autofac, since it knows how to create instances of `Bar` (it's just a matter of invoking its default constructor), and consequently it knows how to build instances of `Foo`.

This works with no additional configurations even if dependencies are reversed (e.g `Bar` depends on `Foo`) or if relationships are implicit, for example when `Foo` depends on `Func<Bar>`, or on `List<Bar>` and the like: Autofac is smart enough to build an instance of the right class and inject it into the right component.

## Here come the primitives

Troubles start when one of the dependencies is a primitive. Suppose that `Foo` also depends on a connection string, which you decided to represent as a `string`:

```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(Bar bar, string connectionString) { }
}
```

You are offered a bunch of native Autofac facilities for registering this class.<br />
Either you can use a lambda:

```csharp
builder.Register(c =>
{
    string connectionString = "someConnectionString";
    var bar = c.Resolve<Bar>();
    return new Foo(bar, connectionString);
});
```

or you can continue using the ordinary `RegisterType<>()`, enhanced with the `withParameter()` facility:

```csharp
builder.RegisterType<Foo>()
    .WithParameter("connectionString", "someConnectionString");
```

### Pain points

This is tollerable as long as there there are just a very little number of primitive dependencies.<br />
It starts stinking when it ends up with code like the following:


```csharp
builder.Register(c =>
{
    string connectionString = "someConnectionString";
    string url = "http://some.url";
    string maxUsers = 19;
    
    var bar = c.Resolve<Bar>();
    var baz = c.Resolve<Baz>()
    return new Foo(bar, baz, connectionString, url, maxUsers);
});
```

or

```csharp
builder.RegisterType<Foo>()
	.WithParameter("connectionString", "someConnectionString")
	.WithParameter("url", "http://some.url")
	.WithParameter("maxUsers", 19);
```

Not only is it verbose and repetitive, but the resulting code is also affected by a couple of problems:

* both the URL and the connection string are represented with the same class (a string), giving no chances to the compiler to know which is which; consequently, it is very possible to switch their values without giving the receiving class the opportunity to detect the issue but at runtime.<br />
Would you spot the problem in the following code?

```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(Bar bar, Baz baz, string connectionString, string url) { }
}

builder.Register(c =>
{
    var bar = c.Resolve<Bar>();
    var baz = c.Resolve<Baz>()
    return new Foo(bar, baz, "http://some.url", "someConnectionString", 19);
});
```

The compiler wouldn't, and that's a pity;

* `withParameter` references parameters by name, as a string, so simple refactoring tasks such as renaming variables become very fragile.<br />
The following code compiles, but it will throw an exception at runtime the moment you will try to resolve `Foo`:


```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(Bar bar, Baz baz, string connectionString, string url) { }
}

builder.RegisterType<Foo>()
	.WithParameter("connectionstring", "someConnectionString")
	.WithParameter("url", "http://some.url")
	.WithParameter("maxUsers", 19);
```

Yes, it's just a matter of a capitalized `S`. Hard to spot, isn't it?

The bad habit of using primitive types to represent domain ideas is a smell called *Primitive Obsession*.<br />
Let's see how to avoid it without endng up with ugly Autofac registration statements.

## The illusory solution
Why do you need to have configuration parameters, in the first place? Of course because you want the freedom to change them at runtime, presumably by using a configuration file:

```csharp
var connectionString = ConfigurationManager.AppSetting["myConnection"];

builder.Register(c =>
{
    var bar = c.Resolve<Bar>();
    return new Foo(bar, connectionString);
});

```

This may suggest you a trick you could be tempted to use: to directly inject `ConfigurationManager.AppSetting` into your classes:

```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(Bar bar, NameValueCollection config)
    {
        var connectionString = config["myConnection"];
    }
}

builder.RegisterType<Foo>();
builder.RegisterInstance(ConfigurationManager.AppSetting).As<NameValueCollection>();
```

Voilï¿½. No more primitives.<br />
You could also be inclined to define a custom service for collecting all of your configuration parameters:

```csharp
class MyConfigs
{
    public T Get<T>(string key)
    {
        ...
    }

    public void LoadFromConfigfile()
    {
        ...
    }
}

builder.RegisterType<Foo>();
builder.RegisterInstance(new MyConfig().LoadFromConfigfile());
```

so that you can easily inject it, as a glorified configuration parameters repository:

```csharp
class Foo
{
    Foo(Bar bar, MyConfigs conf)
    {
        var maxUsers = conf.Get<int>("maxUsers");
    }
}
```

This seems to solve most of the problems related to Primitive Obsession, right?

Well, yes, at least it solves the ugly Autofac registration statements issue. In fact, it introduces some additional problems, possibly worse than the ones it is supposed to solve.

The problem is: that's a Service Locator.<br />
I stronly suggest you to read the seminal Mark Seemann's post [Service Locator Is An Anti-Pattern](http://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern/) which collects a lot of strong arguments on why you should avoid using the Service Locator pattern. Basically, the root of Service Locator's evil is that it hides class dependencies, causing run-time errros and maintenance additional burden.

Service Locator pattern is mostly applied with services, while here you are dealing with values without behaviour, simple strings and integers; yet Mark Seemann's argument apply: injecting a configuration-parameters locator is an anti-pattern anyway.<br />

**Just don't do it.**

## A hint
So what to do? An idea may come from some special cases when configuration parameters come bundled together.

Take a class `Foo` that requires the access an external service `Bar` and therefore needs to receive the url, the username and the access token via injection. It may come natural to group the 3 authentication parameters in a single `BarServiceAuthParameters` class:

```csharp
class BarServiceAuthParameters
{
    string Url { get; }
    string Username { get; }
    string AccessToken { get; }

    public BarServiceAuthParameters(string url, string username, string accessToken)
    {
        Url = url;
        Username = username;
        AccessToken = accessToken;
    }
}

class Foo
{
    public Foo(BarServiceAuthParameters authParams) { }
}
```

Now, registering `Foo` is just:

```csharp
builder.RegisterType<Foo>();
```

since it doesn't depend on any primitives. All the burden is actually left to `BarServiceAuthParameters`, but registering it is also pretty straightforward, because it's just a matter of providing Autofac with an instance, with no other dependencies:

```csharp
builder.RegisterInstance(new BarServiceAuthParameters("http://some.url", "john", "token-123"));
```

It's nice how from `Foo`'s point of view, parameters are just an ordinary dependency.<br />
This should give us a suggestion: by simply wrapping any primitive parameter with a DTO class, you completely avoid Primitive Obsession's issues.

## Winning the Primitive Obsession
So, if you have a composite configuation parameters (such as `BarServiceAuthParameters`), the issue is already fixed, while for simpler, primitive configuration parameters you could do the same, with a dedicated wrapper class.


```csharp
class ConnectionString
{
    public string Value { get; }

    public ConnectionString(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }
}
```

You might find it overengineering. You could be averse to creating those kinds of objects only for holding simple values such as connection strings, user names, integer or floating point levels or values  that you might simply represent with a prmitive type,

Let me try to convince you that there is something deeply wrong with injecting a primitive.<br />
Say you have 2 configuration parameters: `maxDownloadableFiles` and `numerOfItemsPerPage`. They can be defined in 2 completely different contexts, represent 2 completely different ideas, and have nothing to share one with the other.<br />
Yet you can represent both of them with the same type, `int`.


This is the root error: when you use the very same class for 2 completely different purposes, it's just like collapsing `CustomerController` and `NHibernateSession` to a single class. Doing this, you would give no chance neither to Autofac nor to the compiler itself to distinguish the former from the latter.

You surely see the benefit in providing the customer controller and the NHibernate session with 2 dedicated classes: there wouldn't be hard to see the same benefit to using 2 different classes to the 2 configuration parameters. It would give you the opportunity to rely on the rely on the language: instead of having a constructor which takes 3 indistinguishable integers

```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(int maxDownloads, int itemsPerPage, int numberOfDays) { ... }
}
````

you would actually have a maximum number of downloads, a number of items per page and a number of days, each well defined with its specific class, just like everything else:

```csharp
class Foo
{
    public Foo(MaxDownloads maxDownloads, ItemsPerPage itemsPerPage, NumberOfDays numberOfDays) { ... }
}
````

So, the basic trick for dealing with primitives in Autofac is: don't use primitives. Instead, use DTO that wrap one or multiple primitive values. DDD calls those DTO Value Object. Be explicit: [explicit is better than implicit](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

In the the very short post [Primitive Obsession](http://wiki.c2.com/?PrimitiveObsession) Jb Rainsberger claims those kind of Vlaue Object


> [...] become "attractive code", meaning literally a class/module that attracts behavior towards it as new methods/functions. For example, instead of scattering all the parsing/formatting behavior for dates stored as text, introduce a DateFormat class which attracts that behavior as methods called parse() and format(), almost like magic.


So, it's likely that just by introducing the class `URL` you will end up enhancing it with some formatting or validation logic, which you could not do with a plain, primitive `string`.

That's the first step to avoid convoluted registration expression with Autofac.

Now, let's see how to make the solution nicer.

## Enhancing the solution

There are drawbacks with Value Object.

Say you replace `string ConnectionString` with a wrapper class

```csharp
class ConnectionString
{
    public string Value { get; }

    public ConnectionString(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }
}
```

Now it's just more difficult to consume it. You need to write

```csharp
connectionString.Value
```

where it used to be just

```csharp
connectionString
```

since it's not a string anymore. It's also more difficult to assign it a value. Instead of

```csharp
var connectionString = "foobar";
```

you need

```csharp
var connectionString = new ConnectionString("foobar"); 
```

Yawn...


### Extending Primitives and Primary Constructors


If only primitive types weren't not sealed, a solution could even be:

```csharp
class ConnectionString : string { }
class Url : string { }
class MaxUsers : int { }

```

Unfortunately, this isn't supported by C#. You must rely on a  more verbose syntax and write something like:

```csharp
class ConnectionString
{
    public string Value { get; }

    public ConnectionString(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }
}

class Foo
{
    public Foo(Bar bar, ConnectionString connectionString) { }
}

builder.RegisterInstance(new ConnectionString("some value"));
builder.RegisterType<Foo>();
builder.RegisterType<Bar>();
```


Hopefully, C# 6 Primary Constructor shall reduce the glue code, allowing to replace definitions such as

```csharp
class BarServiceAuthParameters
{
    string Url { get; }
    string Username { get; }
    string AccessToken { get; }

    public BarServiceAuthParameters(string url, string username, string accessToken)
    {
        Url = url;
        Username = username;
        AccessToken = accessToken;
    }
}

```

with

```csharp

class BarServiceAuthParameters(string url, string username, string accessToken) { }
```

which is much more terse and elegant.


### `implicit` and `explicit` to the resque
There's another path to explore: it would be nice if it were possible to implicitly cast it from and to strings.

Actually, that's not too hard to achieve. There is a technique Jimmy Bogard brillantly exposed in his post [Dealing with primitive obsession](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2007/12/03/dealing-with-primitive-obsession) that  makes a smart use of the cast operators `implicit` and `explicit` and allows to make you consume and create your Value Objects as they are primitives.

Go and read the post. You will learn that by defining your Value Object as

```csharp
public class ConnectionString
{
    public string Value { get; }

    public ConnectionString(string value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }

    public static implicit operator string(ConnectionString connectionString)
    {
        return connectionString.Value;
    }

    public static explicit operator ConnectionString(string value)
    {
        return new ConnectionString(value);
    }
}
```

you will be able to consume and create it as a primitive, as in the following example:

```csharp

class Foo
{
    public ConnectionString Conn;
}


var foo = new Foo();
foo.Conn = (ConnectionString) "barbaz";

string s = foo.Conn;
```
